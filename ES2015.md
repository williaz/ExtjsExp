### [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

## 1. Basic

#### var/let (block scope)/const (ready-only)

- let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object.

- x=42 -> always declares a global variable (warning)

- undefined - declared with no initial value 

- ReferenceError - undeclared variable

#### undefined VS null
undefined = false, NaN; 
null = false, 0

### Scope
#### global (outside any functoion) VS local (in function) VS block (let)
- Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

### hoisting (undefined)
you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception 

- variables in JavaScript are in a sense "hoisted" or lifted to the top of the function or statement.

- all var statements in a function should be placed as near to the top of the function as possible. 
- 'let' will no hoist
- For functions, only function declaration gets hoisted to the top and not the function expression.

#### const: block scope, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected

### Types
- Boolean
- null
- undefined
- Number
- String
- Symbol: immutable singleton
- Object

- [ ] (only +) In expressions involving numeric and string values with the + operator, JavaScript converts numeric values to strings. 
- parseInt() (better with radix param - num system) / parseFloat()

### Literals
- Array literals: created each time, extra ',' for undefined(ignore trailing comma)<- better explicitly 
- Object literals: You should not use an object literal at the beginning of a statement. This will lead to an error or not behave as you expect, because the { will be interpreted as the beginning of a block. If the property name would not be a valid JavaScript identifier or number, it must be enclosed in quotes. Property names that are not valid identifiers also cannot be accessed as a dot (.) property, but can be accessed and set with the array-like notation("[]").
- Regex literals: pattern enclosed between slashes
- String interpolation: `${name}`

### Escaping using backslash\

### Falsy values
- false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, ""
```javascript
var b = new Boolean(false);
if (b) // this condition evaluates to true
```
### Promise (to control the flow of deferred and asynchronous operations)
- states: pending, settled(fulfilled, rejected)
.then(onFulfillment/onRejection) / .catch(onRejection)

### for...in
- it is better to use a traditional for loop with a numeric index when iterating over arrays, because the for...in statement iterates over user-defined properties in addition to the array elements, if you modify the Array object, such as adding custom properties or methods.

### for...of
 for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over **iterable** objects
 While for...in iterates over property names, for...of iterates over property values

### Destructuring assignment
-  to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.
```javascript
var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
var [one, two, three] = foo;
```

**Strict equal(===)/ !== : type and value**

- Exponentiation operator(\*\*): 2 \*\* 3 = 8

**Short-circuit: &&, ||**

### Unary operator
- delete: deletes an object, an object's property, or an element at a specified index in an array; can use the delete operator to delete variables declared implicitly but not those declared with the var statement.
- typeof
- void(): specifies an expression to be evaluated without returning a value.

### Relational Operators
- in : returns true if the specified property is in the specified object
- iinstanceof

### this
- use this as arg to pass calling object

**Spread Operator**
- allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.
- with function calls also
```javascript
var parts = ['shoulder', 'knees'];
var lyrics = ['head', ...parts, 'and', 'toes'];
```
### Numbers
- Binary: 0B/0b
- Octal: 0[1-7]/0o(ES2015)
- Hex: 0x
- Expon: 1E3, 2e6

### Date
```javascript
var today = new Date();
var Xmas95 = new Date("December 25, 1995 13:30:00");
var Xmas95 = new Date(1995, 11, 25);
var Xmas95 = new Date(1995, 11, 25, 9, 30, 0);.
```

### strings
-  using either single or double quotes

#### String Object
```javascript
var s = new String('foo'); // Creates a String object
console.log(s); // Displays: {'0': 'f', '1': 'o', '2': 'o'}
```
- you can't change characters since strings are immutable array-like objects
**substring() VS substr()**
- substring(start_index, end_index)

- Multi-line template literals `
```javascript
console.log(`string text line 1
string text line 2`);
// "string text line 1
// string text line 2"
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
console.log(`Fifteen is ${a + b} and\nnot ${2 * a + b}.`);
// "Fifteen is 15 and
// not 20."
```
- Internationalization

## 2. Function

### Argument
- Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value
- The arguments of a function are maintained in an **array-like** object. ``` argument[i] ``` useful if you don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed to the function. 
- ES2015-default parameter ``` function multiply(a, b = 1) {} ```
- ES2015-rest parameter ``` function multiply(multiplier, ...theArgs) {} ```

### Function expression
```javascript
var myFunction = function [name]([param1[, param2[, ..., paramN]]]) {
   statements
};
```
- Function expressions are convenient when passing a function as an argument to another function. 
- In JavaScript, a function can be defined based on a condition.
- function hoisting only works with function declaration and not with function expression.

**method VS function**
- A method is a function that is a property of an object. 

### Scope
- The scope of a function is the function in which it is declared, or the entire program if it is declared at the top level.
- a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined


### Closure
- A closure is an expression (typically a function) that can have free variables together with an environment that binds those variables (that "closes" the expression).
-  a nested function is a closure -> the inner function contains the scope of the outer function.
- the inner function can use the arguments and variables of the outer function, while the outer function cannot use the arguments and variables of the inner function.
```javascript
function outside(x) {
  function inside(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
  return inside;
}
fn_inside = outside(3); // Think of it like: give me a function that adds 3 to whatever you give it
result = fn_inside(5); // returns 8

result1 = outside(3)(5); // returns 8
```
- A closure must preserve the arguments and variables in all scopes it references. Since each call provides potentially different arguments, a new closure is created for each call to outside. The memory can be freed only when the returned inside is no longer accessible.
- scope chaining: A(B(C)): B -> A, C-> B => C -> A; Name conflict: More inner scopes take precedence
- The magical **this** variable is very tricky in closures. They have to be used carefully, as what this refers to depends completely on where the function was called, rather than where it was defined.

### Arrow functions
- Arrow functions are always anonymous.
- Arrow functions capture the this value of the enclosing context

### Built-in functon
- eval() : evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.
- isFinite() / isNaN()
- parseFloat() / parseInt() : parse String
- encodeURI() / decodeURI / encodeURICompponent() / decodeURIComponent()
