## 1. Grammer

#### var/let (block scope)/const (ready-only)

- let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object.

- x=42 -> always declares a global variable (warning)

- undefined - declared with no initial value 

- ReferenceError - undeclared variable

#### undefined VS null
undefined = false, NaN; 
null = false, 0

### Scope
#### global (outside any functoion) VS local (in function) VS block (let)
- Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

### hoisting (undefined)
you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception 

- variables in JavaScript are in a sense "hoisted" or lifted to the top of the function or statement.

- all var statements in a function should be placed as near to the top of the function as possible. 
- 'let' will no hoist
- For functions, only function declaration gets hoisted to the top and not the function expression.

#### const: block scope, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected

### Types
- Boolean
- null
- undefined
- Number
- String
- Symbol: immutable singleton
- Object

- [ ] (only +) In expressions involving numeric and string values with the + operator, JavaScript converts numeric values to strings. 
- parseInt() (better with radix param - num system) / parseFloat()

### Literals
- Array literals: created each time, extra ',' for undefined(ignore trailing comma)<- better explicitly 
- Object literals: You should not use an object literal at the beginning of a statement. This will lead to an error or not behave as you expect, because the { will be interpreted as the beginning of a block. If the property name would not be a valid JavaScript identifier or number, it must be enclosed in quotes. Property names that are not valid identifiers also cannot be accessed as a dot (.) property, but can be accessed and set with the array-like notation("[]").
- Regex literals: pattern enclosed between slashes
- String interpolation: `${name}`

### Escaping using backslash\
